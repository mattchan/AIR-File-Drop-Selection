This was an experiment (an incomplete one at that) for performing drag-and-drop
of files into an Adobe AIR application and taking some action on the file. The
concept of the "action" is abstract in this project; they are just items in a
list but can represent whatever you want. Files can be dragged from the desktop
or within the AIR file system browser.

Things that were never completed:
 * Scrolling when you drag an item into the list
 * ComboBox control alternative. It opens when you drag over, but there is no
   handler for the drop or doing the selection thereafter.
